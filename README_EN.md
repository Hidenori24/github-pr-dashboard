Visualize PR status, review progress, and bottlenecks intuitively to improve your development team's productivity.

## Two Versions

This repository provides two implementations:

1. **[Streamlit Version](dashboard/)** - Python-based dashboard running on local PC
2. **[GitHub Pages Version](Dashboard_pages/)** - Static web application that can be published on GitHub Pages (Recommended)

| Feature | Streamlit Version | GitHub Pages Version |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Runtime | Local PC | Cloud (Free) |
| Setup | Python environment required | Not required (Browser only) |
| Auto Update | Manual setup | GitHub Actions (Automatic) |
| Access | localhost | Public URL |
| Team Sharing | Difficult | Easy (Share URL) |

For GitHub Pages version usage, see [Dashboard_pages/README.md](Dashboard_pages/README.md).

## Four Keys Metrics (DORA Metrics)

Measure software development performance using the four key metrics from DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA).

### The Four Key Metrics

1. **Deployment Frequency**
   - How often code is deployed to production
   - Calculated from the number of merged PRs
   - High-performing teams deploy multiple times per day

2. **Lead Time for Changes**
   - Time from commit to production deployment
   - Measured as average time from PR creation to merge
   - High-performing teams achieve less than one day

3. **Change Failure Rate**
   - Percentage of deployments causing failures or requiring fixes
   - Calculated from the ratio of closed to merged PRs
   - High-performing teams stay below 15%

4. **Time to Restore Service (MTTR)**
   - Time from production incident to recovery
   - Measured by resolution time of issues tagged as hotfix
   - High-performing teams recover in less than one hour

### Performance Levels

Four performance levels based on DORA Metrics:

- **Elite**: Top level across all metrics
- **High**: Excellent in most metrics
- **Medium**: Average performance
- **Low**: Room for improvement

## Statistics & Weekly Reports

Provides comprehensive statistics to understand current development processes and find opportunities for improvement.

### Key Metrics

- **Period Summary**: Total PRs, merge rate, average lead time, active developers
- **Trend Analysis**: 8-week trends for PR creation and average lead time
- **Review Activity**: Total reviews, total comments, averages per PR

### Automated Insights

Automatically generates insights from statistical data:

- Detection of increased/decreased development activity
- Analysis of improved/delayed review speed
- Merge rate evaluation
- Review activity monitoring
- Stale PR warnings

### Improvement Recommendations

Provides specific action items based on current issues:

- Methods to reduce review time
- Fostering review culture
- Strategies to improve PR completion rate
- Promoting team collaboration
